---------

This is a simple exemplar app which allows you to create, edit, delete and list blogs. It has minimal styling.

It was written with mongoDB, express.js, react.js and node.js... hence the **mern**.

To start the client server cd into client folder and run _npm run start_, client will appear on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

To start the server, cd into the server folder and type _npm start_. The server then runs on [http://localhost:5000/api](http://localhost:5000/api) and connects to a mongoDB cluster on [https://www.mongodb.com/](https://www.mongodb.com/).
